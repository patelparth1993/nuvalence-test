# nuvalence-test

## Deployment and Run Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. cd <clone_repo_path>/client
3. npm install
4. ng serve

## Summary
1. Angular Material and SCSS are used keeping time and simplicity in mind. 
2. I have only implement required and basic features (user list and user details page) with responsiveness. From UX perspective, very few changes have been made to make the application presentable
3. Given more time, I would have included pagination on Users/Home Page, made user details page extensive with more details, better UI/UX. Ideally this wont take long. 
4. Would have written more unit tests, but to be honest, I would have to explore a few things.
